      <description>writeup While reading &amp;ldquo;Learning Go: An Idiomatic Approach&amp;rdquo; by Jon Bodner, I used a pomodoro app on my phone that I found really neat to track my time. The only thing that I didn&amp;rsquo;t like about it is that it didn&amp;rsquo;t count excess time once the countdown reached zero, so I decided to make my own as a side project to practice Go.&#xA;A blogpost by a good mutual @kennethnym on Twitter titled &amp;ldquo;the art of programming and why i won&amp;rsquo;t use llm&amp;rdquo; shaped my approach for this project.</description>

Seriously, it’s really simple.&#xA;what is natural language processing? Natural language processing, NLP for short, is how a computer can understand language. It’s a process that has a number of steps and components in order for it to work.</description>

      <description>My First Epoch whoami Greetings, my name is Jericho Imperial, currently a 4th year CS undergrad who is addicted to the drug called “self-studying deep learning!” I’m technically a 4.5th year undergrad, because I am one class short even though my school let walk on stage and didn’t notify me of this issue beforehand, but anyways, welcome to my first “academic” blog about deep learning! Here’s a lot about me.</description>

      <description>welcome! hey this is my first blog ever! i initially made this website to write about whatever i learned in fastai since they recommended it, but i’ll probably write about whatever else i’m learning, my projects, thoughts in tech, and maybe thoughts in general. this website is my 3rd website ever made and 1st project made with svelte. so far i love how svelte is with their routing, it just seems super intuitive and easy.</description>
