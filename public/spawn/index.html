<p>i was feeling really sad last night. i was on call with Black, Blue, and Pink for 4 hours. i caught up with them, talked about random stuff, and made up blatant targeted rules for their drinking game all while realizing i was in my bed, 2413 miles away, staring into the popcorn ceiling.</p>
<p>it was so fun! i haven&rsquo;t felt this way since the last time we all hung out irl last year, i felt human. i found it funny how i would blurt out a genuine epiphany mid-conversation and it would make them laugh because it didn&rsquo;t make any sense to them, but they understood.</p>
<p>they ordered popeyes, but their doordasher cheated on them and went to mcdonalds to fulfill another order at the same time.</p>
<p>some simple conversations that i liked that killed me:</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><em>Pink do you like him? &ndash;yeah</em>. why do they like me? <em>why do you ask?</em> because i&rsquo;m weird, i&rsquo;m not normal. <em>well i&rsquo;m friends with them and i&rsquo;m not normal</em>. you aren&rsquo;t? <em>yeah</em>. but they&rsquo;re normal though. <em>no they&rsquo;re not</em>. really? <em>what do you think normal people like?</em> normal people. <em>what does normal mean to you?</em> idk, just not me. <em>well we like you</em>. but why? <em>a beautiful mirror can&rsquo;t see itself</em>. woah who taught you that? <em>myself hehe</em></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><em>either way it doesn&rsquo;t matter</em>. but what if X and Y are true, it doesn&rsquo;t make sense right? <em>either way it doesn&rsquo;t matter, bro what?</em> you&rsquo;re not getting it, i&rsquo;m saying &ldquo;what if X and Y are true?&rdquo; <em>either way it doesn&rsquo;t matter, you&rsquo;re still you</em>. &ldquo;either way it doesn&rsquo;t matter&rdquo; huh. <em>that&rsquo;s literally what i&rsquo;ve been saying</em> to you! well i just got it, maybe its because the coffee is gone. <em>what does that have to do with this?</em></p>
<p>anyways, im pretty sure i need to go outside more.</p>
