<p>its kinda crazy how i have 1k oomfies following me. it&rsquo;s not really about the goal of reaching it; it&rsquo;s just that past me could never imagine. even if it did happen back then, i wouldve been scared to interact with or tweet to that amount of people. i used to be so frightened being perceived by people, knowing who, and how i am.</p>
<p>nowadays, i dont really care anymore, just a tiny bit. it took me so long to get the over these humps, but as time went by each hump got smaller and smaller. im at the point where i&rsquo;m happy to share my story; i can finally see the sun over the hill.</p>
<h3 id="early-game">early game</h3>
<p>back in my day, i used to live on the internet (still do). i would hop on roblox to roleplay being in a high tech military after school, play minecraft and s3 league of legends while on a skype call with people thousands of miles away that i would never see irl, and spend hours typing to random people in twitch chat. i felt safe online.</p>
<p>then came this one anime mmorpg called mabinogi that i played religiously. whenever someone would come up to talk to me ingame, i would pretend to be afk until they&rsquo;d walk away. i&rsquo;d even log off or change servers to avoid them lol. there was something about that game&rsquo;s freedom of expression, personalization, and open social community that scared me. now that i think about it, this was my first signal of my growing social anxiety.</p>
<h3 id="mid-game">mid game</h3>
<p>10 years later, and my social anxiety grew to be a raid boss. whenever i took a stroll in the park, it was hard for me to look people in the eye that were walking past. when i attempted to, i would have anxiety attacks; i couldn&rsquo;t breathe, i was sweating out of my mind, and i felt like i was going to have a heart attack lol.</p>
<p>to counteract, i cut off all forms of caffeine as i knew it&rsquo;d increase my anxiety and i would even avoid humans irl. if i was walking on the street and saw my neighbor doing something outside, i would cross the street. if it was unavoidable, i would pretend as if they didn&rsquo;t exist, but i would still feel super anxious afterwards. what was wrong?</p>
<p>at that time, i didn&rsquo;t really know or understand. i did everything i could to avoid the problem, but i never really faced it. i didn&rsquo;t really care about my anxiety until i thought about my future. when im older, i see myself living a stereotypical life: a wife that loves me, a good paying job, and a couple of hopefully good kids. it raised the question of &ldquo;how do i achieve all of this if i cant even look people in the eye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>how would i find a girlfriend if i was too scared to talk to people, especially women (unironically. it&rsquo;s really funny because my closest friends are all women)? how am i going to get a job through an interview if it&rsquo;s hard for me to talk to cashiers. how would i raise good kids if they have a dad that didn&rsquo;t understand the world, or can&rsquo;t even show the world to them thanks to inexperience of life due to the shackles of anxiety?</p>
<h3 id="farming">farming</h3>
<p>at that point, i started to challenge myself. i started to take walks at the park; i would dress up in outfits that i&rsquo;d keep in the closet and walk looking straight instead of staring at the floor. i would even look up to look at the trees, just anything that would let me see people.</p>
<p>i started to go to coffee shops and say &ldquo;hi, how are you&rdquo; instead of blurting out my order. sometimes i&rsquo;d ask what they&rsquo;d recommend, stir some ez conversations with clear and simple interactions that are spammable.</p>
<p>later on, i started to go to places i&rsquo;ve never been, the infamous duc huong on mckee in san jose. i remember standing outside in a line, in an outfit i was scared to wear, standing around for what felt like hours, only to finally get my viet coffee and take a sip and understanding how it was all worth it.</p>
<p>i also went to my first library, the new one in hayward. it stunned me; it was the prettiest library i&rsquo;ve ever seen at that time, and i asked myself &ldquo;are there more places like this?&rdquo; after sitting down and taking it all in, i looked around and noticed that everyone was studying or reading. i was there, but nobody gave a single fuck about me, strange.</p>
<h3 id="late-game">late game</h3>
<p>later on, i started to limit test. i started to post on twitter; i joined some public discord servers and started to speak into the void. i went into the deep and decided to go to my first convention ever, nvidia gtc!</p>
<p>i asked in a discord if anyone was going as well and someone pinged me about it, what!?! at this point, do i just delete my message and pretend i didn&rsquo;t say anything or do i delete my discord account and make them think they were schizophrenic for my anxiety&rsquo;s sake? well, they weren&rsquo;t able to go anyways, but i guess i made a new friend; perhaps they were the first oomfie to ever exist.</p>
<p>this oomfie helped me go to my first hackathon where i met more oomfies, and helped me go to my 2nd ever convention/conference to meet more oomfies, yada yada yada. fast forward now, i&rsquo;ve met multiple random people (now oomfies) by myself from twitter! i hyperscaled just by existing and meeting one person, but it didn&rsquo;t happen overnight. the hills got smaller and smaller every interaction and a sliver of light finally hit my face.</p>
<h3 id="victory-screen">victory screen</h3>
<p>after all that, i guess im okay. i can talk to cashiers regularly now, sometimes. couple months ago ordering in-n-out, my anxiety peaked mid-order while they were asking me what drink i&rsquo;d like. i sat in my car for 1-2 minutes literally frozen but finally said &ldquo;pink lemonade,&rdquo; the worker&rsquo;s face was literally dumbfounded lmfao w/e.</p>
<p>you can&rsquo;t get rid of social anxiety, but you can definitely get used to it. what works for me is just noticing it, letting it happen, and being kind to yourself afterwards. i can finally express myself freely online and in-person, although i still struggle in unfamiliar group settings like parties and even discord vcs, but im surprisingly comfortable with 1v1s. most importantly, i can now say &ldquo;hello&rdquo; to random people walking past, look them in the eye, and smile.</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s been a good journey so far, i&rsquo;ve been feeling human, the sun seems unusually bright. i&rsquo;m super excited to see where i am in 5 years. i started this journey seriously at the start of the new year and i&rsquo;ve come a long way. i guess my next task is to do something about being socially inept, but i&rsquo;m not sure if that&rsquo;s something that can be helped or not lol.</p>
<p>if you&rsquo;re reading up to this point and feel like social anxiety has had a toll on your life, remember anything is possible. it&rsquo;s okay to be scared; that fear can be a sign that you&rsquo;re ready to grow. all it takes is consistency, patience, and tiny steps. you don&rsquo;t have to face this alone - reach out, connect, and take that first small step towards the person you want to be. and hey, if you need someone to talk to who&rsquo;s been there, my DMs are open. we&rsquo;re all in this together oomfies. glhf on your journey!</p>
