# the hiatus

### What happened?

It's been about 2 months since my last blog and a lot has happened. To summarize, I’ve been learning a lot. I learned about ML in tabular data by utilizing random forests and neural nets, feature engineering, differential calculus, mathematical and conceptual details of neural and convnets, interviewing skills, and currently the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm.

Two months may seem like a short timeline but it felt so long. Just now, I feel like I finally caught up to the year. I put my extracurricular studies on hold to adapt to school, paused my school studies for interviews, and put my life on hold for interviews. Thankfully, now that life has calmed down, interviews are done, and now that I’m caught up on school work, I can finally continue the actual grind; projects and passions!

### What changed?

Let’s start with studies. I used study 4-6 hours a day on Jeremy Howard’s Practical Deep Learning course, but since school came around I stopped and planned to come back to it as soon as possible. It didn’t work out, but I found it to be a blessing since the college course I’m taking goes into deep learning through a mathematical and conceptual lens. Now, I have a deeper understanding of general neural nets and convnets which is awesome.

I’m more introspective and self-aware. To put it short, I have anxiety and realized that I’m high functioning on the spectrum. For the past 5 years, I always wanted to try to be normal, but through these two months I realized that I literally can’t, it’s a good thing. I’m now on the road to becoming the best weird version of myself. In other words, I’ve been walking backwards in time while watching myself with gentle and forgiving eyes through these recent and past events, situations, and obstacles.

### What now?

Now that the shackles are off, I plan to continue my extracurricular studies through projects and implementation. My college course made me write neural and convnets from scratch using NumPy, it made me confident that I can do more and learn more deeply. Also, I truly believe in a personalized internet, so one of passion project on my bucket list is to revamp this website and buy a domain to expand my self. Other than that, I plan to be more challenging on myself socially. I realized I can’t conquer anxiety or wish to not be socially inept, so I plan to go to events and places by myself and finally get to experience what interests me.

2023 was an amazing year for my career and social life, I just know 2024 is going to beat it.
