i drink so much caffeine, i like to drink hot coffee, matcha, and especially viet ice coffee. i don’t like energy drinks as much, but they’re there. after switching the drinks around, i notice that different types of drinks i crave depend where i am in my life.

### hot coffee

hot coffee just gives me comfy vibes. i dont drink these as often anymore, but every time i do i’m probably playing an RPG or grinding an MMO on a winter morning with the windows open. it serves as something to drink rather than function.

### matcha

honestly i’ve seen all the girlies drink it and decided to give it a try, now i love matcha so much. to me it tastes between nothing or a 50 year old copper penny, but add some honey in it and it’s 10x better than hot coffee with sweetener. it’s easier and faster to make than coffee, plus it looks better and healthier due to it’s green hue. whenever i make my own, it’s a good ritual before i get started on some work. overall, a chill drink that gives me so much function on a great productive and low urgency day.

### viet coffee

if you’re in san jose or nearby garden grove and don’t get a viet ice coffee, you’re missing out. whenever i’m out an about with plans, viet coffee is my #1 priority. other than its acquired bitter taste that i love, it’s also a ritual of mine before or after i touch grass. going to have an interview? viet ice coffee. going out to a place you’ve never been before alone? viet ice coffee. big social day today? viet ice coffee. it’s a drink that prepares me to go out of my comfort zone, it’s the last hug i get before i sky dive. as weird as it sounds, it’s a drink that helps against my social anxiety despite being highly caffeinated.

### monster

[switching gears by abaddon](https://open.spotify.com/track/4907JxxL55iwgP8BxXA9Ql?si=5b41716b5bb94938), [goth rave (remix) by fkoff1963](https://open.spotify.com/track/5cNixIB0qxfj7HlblASAzt?si=5ac5efbede7c4c22), [bass slut by s3rl](https://open.spotify.com/track/51czegKF9UbmUZkp8etKj2?si=b84e2f3139e0444e), these are my favorite songs to play when im drinking monster. like fuck it lets just perma go. it’s a rave for my brain to get work done. i don’t drink this as often, but sometimes i just get it once in a while when i’m doing groceries and decide to queue it up. it honestly doesn’t do anything other than setting a different productive mood. also the pink can looks really pretty, the aesthetic is like 75% of the decision to drink it.
