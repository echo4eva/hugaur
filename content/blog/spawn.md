i was feeling really sad last night. i was on call with Black, Blue, and Pink for 4 hours. i caught up with them, talked about random stuff, and made up blatant targeted rules for their drinking game all while realizing i was in my bed, 2413 miles away, staring into the popcorn ceiling.

it was so fun! i haven't felt this way since the last time we all hung out irl last year, i felt human. i found it funny how i would blurt out a genuine epiphany mid-conversation and it would make them laugh because it didn't make any sense to them, but they understood. 

they ordered popeyes, but their doordasher cheated on them and went to mcdonalds to fulfill another order at the same time.

some simple conversations that i liked that killed me:

...

*Pink do you like him? --yeah*. why do they like me? *why do you ask?* because i'm weird, i'm not normal. *well i'm friends with them and i'm not normal*. you aren't? *yeah*. but they're normal though. *no they're not*. really? *what do you think normal people like?* normal people. *what does normal mean to you?* idk, just not me. *well we like you*. but why? *a beautiful mirror can't see itself*. woah who taught you that? *myself hehe*

...

*either way it doesn't matter*. but what if X and Y are true, it doesn't make sense right? *either way it doesn't matter, bro what?* you're not getting it, i'm saying "what if X and Y are true?" *either way it doesn't matter, you're still you*. "either way it doesn't matter" huh. *that's literally what i've been saying* to you! well i just got it, maybe its because the coffee is gone. *what does that have to do with this?*

anyways, im pretty sure i need to go outside more.
